# Ontologies for CRC 1218

## List of resources to browse ontologies

Repositories for biomedical ontologies:

- [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/)
- [Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/index)

Combination of parts of several biological ontologies â€“ multi-domain ontologies*:

- [Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/)

*Depending on the context, it can make more sense to use a multi-domain ontology with suitbale coverage to improve consistency and interoperability ([The FAIR Cookbook > 5. Selecting terminologies and ontologies](https://w3id.org/faircookbook/FCB020)).

For cross-referencing terms from ontologies, vocabularies and coding standards.

- [Ontology Mapping (OxO)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/oxo/), imports mappings from a variety of sources including the [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/index) and a subset of mappings provided by the [Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html).
